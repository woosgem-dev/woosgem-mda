# shared/manifest.yaml — Cross-domain modules

structure:
  tokens: tokens/spec.yaml
  csp: csp/spec.yaml
  utils: utils/spec.yaml
  types: types/spec.yaml

rules:
  - "Code used by only one domain must move to that domain"
  - "Utils must be pure functions (no side effects)"
  - "Token changes affect all domains — require decisions/ record"
  - "No framework-specific logic in shared modules"
